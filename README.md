## Hi there, I'm Gabriel ðŸš€
- Building the future, one line of code at a time.

### About Me

- I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student with a strong interest in turning ideas into digital solutions. My current focus is on building a solid foundation in **programming**, **databases**, and **web development**, always seeking to learn and apply new technologies.

- I am actively looking for an opportunity to start my career, either as an **intern** or a **junior developer**.

 ### My Learning Journey

I'm currently focused on:
- Learning fundamental programming concepts with **JavaScript**.
- Understanding how to build web pages using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Exploring the basics of database management.

I'm also working on my first personal projects to apply what I'm learning. You can follow my progress on my repositories.
